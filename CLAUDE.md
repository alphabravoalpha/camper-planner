## Architecture Principles

### 1. Future-Proof Foundation

Build V1 as if V2 already exists, just disabled. Components should be
enhanceable, not replaceable.

### 2. Configuration-Driven Development

Features are enabled/disabled via feature flags. V2 features are consolidated in
`v2-features/` directory.

### 3. Privacy-First Design

- Local storage primary (browser as database)
- No user tracking or accounts required
- Exportable data (users own their information)
- Zero monthly hosting costs

### 4. Progressive Enhancement

- Static site capable
- Works offline once loaded
- Graceful degradation when APIs fail

- **CampsiteService** - Overpass API for OSM campsite data (35KB, full
  implementation)
- **CampsiteFilterService** - Advanced campsite filtering and search
- **CampsiteOptimizationService** - Campsite recommendation algorithms
- **RouteOptimizationService** - TSP solver for multi-stop optimization
- **TripPlanningService** - Duration estimation and itinerary planning (27KB)

- **BookingService** - Affiliate link generation (Booking.com, Eurocampings,
  camping.info) — wired to CampsiteDetails UI
- **TripWizardService** - Trip planning wizard with itinerary generation
- **DataService** - Base service with caching and rate limiting

**V2 features** are consolidated in `v2-features/` at project root (see
`v2-features/README.md`).

## Key Constraints

### V1 Scope Control

**SCOPE CONTROL RULE:** Any feature not explicitly listed in
`docs/02-feature-requirements.md` requires separate approval before
implementation.

### Explicitly Excluded from V1

- User accounts or cloud synchronization
- Real-time traffic or weather data
- Complex affiliate tracking (simple link generation is V1, advanced booking is
  V2)
- Advanced booking integration (availability checks, price comparison — V2)
- Community features (reviews, sharing)

### API Integration Notes

- **Rate Limiting:** Client-side throttling required (OpenRouteService:
  2,000/day, Nominatim: 1/second)
- **Fallback Strategy:** Multiple backup services configured for each API
- **Caching:** Aggressive local caching to minimize API calls
- **Error Handling:** Graceful degradation when services unavailable

## Data Architecture

### Local Storage Schema

Designed for evolution - V1 data must migrate cleanly to V2. All trip data
stored locally with version tracking for schema migration.

### Vehicle Restrictions

Core feature differentiator - routes must respect:

- Height (bridges, tunnels)
- Weight (road limits)
- Width (narrow roads)
- Length (turning radius)

## Development Philosophy

### Core Principles

1. **Quality AND Delivery** - Ship quality features with strategic testing.
   Perfect is the enemy of done.
2. **Strategic Testing** - Test business logic thoroughly (services), validate
   critical paths, manual test the rest.
3. **Build-Test-Ship Cycle** - Build feature → Manual test → Fix bugs → Ship.
   Iterate based on real usage.
4. **Focus on Impact** - Prioritize features users need over features that might
   be nice.
5. **Plan for Growth** - V1 decisions must support V2/V3 goals without
   architectural rewrites.
6. **Zero Ongoing Costs** - Leverage free tiers and static hosting to maintain
   sustainability.
7. **Privacy by Design** - No tracking, local storage primary, user data
   ownership.

### Development Standards

**Code Quality:**

- TypeScript strict mode, no `any` types
- ESLint and Prettier compliance
- Comprehensive error handling
- Clear, documented code

**Testing Strategy (Pragmatic):**

- **Services**: 80% coverage minimum (CRITICAL - business logic) ✅ ACHIEVED:
  86%
- **Critical UI**: 30-40% coverage (map, waypoints, core interactions)
- **Integration**: 5 key user workflows (E2E tests with Playwright)
- **Manual**: Pre-launch validation (browsers, devices, accessibility)
- **Everything else**: Manual testing during development, fix bugs as found

**Testing Tiers:**

1. MUST TEST: Services (86% coverage, 357 tests) ✅ COMPLETE
2. SHOULD TEST: Critical components (MapContainer, WaypointManager)
3. CAN SKIP: Simple UI (buttons, forms) - manual verification only
4. PRE-LAUNCH: 5 integration tests + cross-browser/device validation

**Before Moving to Next Phase:**

- [ ] Core features implemented and working
- [ ] Service layer tested (business logic validated)
- [ ] Critical paths manually tested
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] No critical bugs in core workflows
- [ ] User feedback incorporated

**Never:**

- Ship features with untested business logic (services MUST have tests)
- Skip manual testing of user-facing features
- Ignore obvious bugs to meet deadlines
- Break existing functionality without fixing it
- Launch without validating critical user workflows

## Recent Updates (February 27, 2026)

### Lighthouse Audit & Fixes (PR #13)

- Full Lighthouse audit: Performance 76, Accessibility 100, Best Practices 96,
  SEO 100
- Performance gap is structural (map tile LCP 5.8s — inherent to map-centric SPA
  on GitHub Pages)
- Fixes applied: lazy-loaded MapContainer, preconnect to tile subdomains, DNS
  prefetch for Overpass, image width/height attributes, font display:optional
- Accessibility fixes: heading order in BlogCard, footer contrast, descriptive
  link text
- Results documented in `docs/plans/lighthouse-results.md`

### Brand Identity Refresh (PR #14)

- Replaced all logos, favicons, and illustration assets with consistent brand
  identity
- Updated `public/og-image.png` (1200×633), `public/logo.png`,

### UX Audit & Fixes (PR #15)

End-to-end UX audit across desktop (1280×800), mobile (375×812), and tablet
(768×1024) viewports. 8 issues identified, 7 fixed:

- **EmptyStateCard overlap** (Major): Card now hides when search bar is focused
  via `isSearchActive` state in `MapContainer.tsx`
- **Ko-fi iframe clipping** (Major): Widened max-width from 400px to 480px in
  `SupportPage.tsx`
- **Blog horizontal overflow** (Major): Fixed flexbox min-width bug with
  `min-w-0 overflow-x-hidden` on `<main>` in `MainLayout.tsx` +
  `overflow-x-hidden` on category tabs in `BlogListPage.tsx`
- **Planning Tools tab truncation** (Minor): Renamed "Analysis" → "Stats",
  reduced padding `px-4` → `px-3` in `PlanningTools.tsx`
- **Route debug info exposed** (Minor): Removed service name ("Osrm") and
  timestamp from `RouteCalculator.tsx` and `RouteInformation.tsx`
- **Mobile menu missing Support** (Minor): Added Support link to hamburger menu
  in `Header.tsx`
- **Deferred:** UX-007 campsite control bar overlap (low-impact cosmetic)

  when a `bug`-labelled issue is opened; posts diagnostics as a comment

**Feedback Pipeline:**

- Google Form collects feedback → responses land in Google Sheet
- Bug reports auto-create GitHub Issues via Google Apps Script
  (`scripts/google-form-to-github-issue.gs`)
- GitHub Actions runs automated triage on new bug issues
- Owner reviews notifications and asks Claude Code to investigate/fix
