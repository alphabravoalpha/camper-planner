The lower town (Bastide Saint-Louis) has a more authentic atmosphere, with good restaurants and a Saturday morning market.

Vehicles over 3.5 tonnes pay Class 2 rates, which are roughly 50% higher than car rates. For example, the A7 from Lyon to Marseille costs approximately 45-55 euros for a Class 2 vehicle in one direction. The A8 along the Cote d'Azur from Aix-en-Provence to Nice adds another 25-30 euros. These costs add up quickly on a multi-week trip."},{type:"paragraph",content:"Fortunately, Southern France has an excellent network of toll-free roads. The Routes Nationales (N roads) and Routes Departementales (D roads) run parallel to most autoroutes and are usually only 20-40 minutes slower for a typical motorhome journey. They are also significantly more scenic. The major toll-free alternatives are: N7 and D7N as an alternative to the A7 through the Rhone valley; N98 and D559 along the coast instead of the A8; and N113 through the Languedoc instead of the A9. Our route planner can calculate toll-free routes automatically when you set the avoid-tolls option in your vehicle profile."},{type:"tip",content:"If you must use a toll autoroute, the Liber-t electronic tag works for motorhomes and gives a slight discount.

Medieval town centres often have archways and gates well under 3 metres. Car parks frequently have 2.0m or 2.1m height barriers. Even some modern supermarket car parks use barriers to prevent overnight motorhome parking. Always know your vehicle's exact height including any roof boxes, antennas, or air conditioning units, and watch for the diamond-shaped yellow height restriction signs posted before tunnels and underpasses."},{type:"paragraph",content:"Narrow village roads are another challenge, particularly in the Luberon, the hill villages above the Cote d'Azur, and the Cathar country of the Languedoc. Many D-roads through villages were built for horse carts and are genuinely too narrow for vehicles over 2.3 metres wide. Wing mirrors are vulnerable. As a general rule, if your GPS is routing you through the centre of a small hilltop village, look for an alternative route around it. Park outside and walk in -- the walk is usually short and always more pleasant than a stressful drive through streets where your mirrors scrape the shutters."},{type:"warning",content:"Never rely solely on a standard car GPS for motorhome navigation.

Keep to the right-hand lane on dual carriageways and autoroutes -- French drivers can be aggressive about overtaking and will flash their lights if they feel you are blocking. Fill up with diesel at supermarket stations (Leclerc, Intermarche, Carrefour), which are consistently 10-15 cents per litre cheaper than autoroute or branded stations. Plan your fuel stops in advance, as some smaller D-roads in rural Provence and the Languedoc can have 50-kilometre stretches without a petrol station."},{type:"paragraph",content:"Wind is a factor that catches many motorhome drivers off guard. The Mistral is a powerful north-westerly wind that funnels down the Rhone valley and across Provence, sometimes reaching speeds of 100 km/h or more. It can make driving a high-sided motorhome genuinely dangerous, particularly on exposed bridges and open stretches of road. When the Mistral is blowing hard, avoid driving if possible, or stick to sheltered routes through valleys rather than exposed plateaux. The Mistral is most common in winter and spring, but can occur at any time of year. Weather forecasts in the region always mention it specifically."},{type:"paragraph",content:"Parking for shopping and sightseeing requires some planning. French supermarkets generally have large car parks that can accommodate motorhomes, but check for height barriers before entering. For sightseeing, look for dedicated motorhome parking areas (often signposted on the approach to tourist towns) or park in the outer zones of regular car parks.

How many people are travelling, and what are their space expectations? If you are a couple who has tent-camped for years, a campervan will feel luxurious. If your partner expects a proper bed and a bathroom door that closes, a motorhome is the safer choice. Where specifically are you going? The Amalfi Coast, Cinque Terre, and the Greek islands are campervan territory -- motorhomes over 7 metres face serious access problems. Scandinavia, France, and Germany have excellent motorhome infrastructure and wide roads where a larger vehicle is no disadvantage."},{type:"paragraph",content:"How long is your trip? For a week or two, a campervan is often sufficient -- you can tolerate limited space for a short period and the lower costs add up. For trips of a month or more, the extra living space and storage of a motorhome becomes increasingly valuable. The psychological impact of cramped quarters compounds over time, and what felt cosy in week one can feel claustrophobic by week four."},{type:"paragraph",content:"Finally, consider the logistics of your specific itinerary. If your route includes multiple city stops, frequent driving days, and varied terrain, a campervan gives you flexibility.

European campsites use the CEE blue industrial connector (also called the camping plug or caravan plug) -- a round, three-pin, blue-capped plug rated for outdoor use.
