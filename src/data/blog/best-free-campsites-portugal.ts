        'Portugal has earned a near-mythical reputation among campervan and motorhome travellers, and for good reason. The country combines year-round mild weather, stunning Atlantic coastline, cheap fuel by Western European standards, and a network of affordable municipal campsites that rivals anything in France or Spain. For budget-conscious travellers, Portugal offers what few other countries can: the ability to spend weeks or even months exploring without spending a fortune on accommodation.',

        "The cost of living in Portugal remains significantly lower than in northern Europe. Diesel prices hover around \u20ac1.50-1.65 per litre, supermarket shopping is 30-40% cheaper than in the UK or Germany, and campsite fees at municipal sites often come in under \u20ac10 per night including electricity. Compare that to the Cote d'Azur or the Italian lakes, where even basic pitches can cost \u20ac35-50 per night in summer, and you begin to see why Portugal attracts such a loyal community of returning campervans every autumn.",

The country is compact enough to cross north-to-south in a single day, yet varied enough to offer surf beaches, medieval hill towns, terraced vineyards, and wild mountain scenery within a few hours' drive of each other. The food is exceptional and affordable -- grilled sardines and a glass of vinho verde for under \u20ac8 at a local tasca is a daily reality, not a tourist fantasy. Add reliable 4G coverage across most of the country and a generally welcoming attitude toward travellers, and you have the perfect destination for extended camper trips.",

      content:
        "Before diving into specific locations, it is essential to understand the legal landscape. Portugal's relationship with free camping has changed dramatically in recent years, and the carefree days of parking anywhere along the coast are largely over. In 2021, the Portuguese government introduced Decree-Law 102/2021, which significantly tightened rules around camping outside designated areas. The law was a direct response to the environmental damage caused by mass free-camping along the Algarve and Alentejo coasts, where popular spots were being overwhelmed by hundreds of vehicles each summer.",
    },
    {
      type: 'paragraph',
      content:
        "Under the current rules, camping outside officially licensed campsites or designated motorhome areas is technically illegal throughout Portugal. This includes sleeping in your vehicle on public roads, in car parks, or on beaches. Fines range from \u20ac200 to \u20ac4,000 for individuals, and enforcement has increased noticeably since 2022, particularly in the Algarve, the Vicentine Coast Natural Park, and popular surf towns. The GNR (Guarda Nacional Republicana, Portugal's rural police) now conduct regular patrols of known free-camping hotspots, especially during summer months.",

        'Camping in protected natural areas such as the Parque Natural do Sudoeste Alentejano e Costa Vicentina carries the highest fines. Rangers actively patrol these areas during peak season. Several well-known free camping spots along the Vicentine Coast have been closed with barriers and signage since 2023.',
    },
    {
      type: 'paragraph',
      content:
        'That said, enforcement varies enormously by region and season. In practice, a single motorhome parked discreetly in a village, at a designated rest area, or in a rural inland spot overnight is unlikely to be disturbed outside of peak season. The crackdowns have focused primarily on large groups of vehicles congregating in coastal areas during summer. The key distinction is between "overnight parking" (pernoita) and "camping" (campismo). Parking your vehicle overnight without putting out awnings, chairs, or other camping equipment is generally more tolerated, though technically still in a grey area. Many Portuguese municipalities have responded to the new laws by creating official motorhome service areas (areas de servico) that offer legal overnight parking for modest fees.',

        'Winter is when Portugal truly shines for budget campervan travel. The Algarve becomes a de facto motorhome community, with thousands of northern European travellers escaping the cold for months at a time. Campsite prices drop by 30-50% from peak rates, and many municipal sites remain open year-round. Daytime temperatures in the Algarve average 15-18\u00b0C, warm enough for comfortable outdoor living with a decent heating system in your van for the cooler evenings. Rainfall is moderate -- you will get wet days, but extended dry spells are common.',

        'The main drawback of winter is that the north can be genuinely cold and wet. The Minho region receives significant rainfall from November to March, and mountain areas including the Serra da Estrela and Peneda-Geres can see snow. If you are visiting in winter, plan to spend the majority of your time in the Algarve, southern Alentejo, or the Lisbon coast, venturing north only during dry spells.',

        "Spring is arguably the best overall season for campervan travel in Portugal. The Alentejo plains burst into colour with wildflowers, the Algarve warms up nicely without summer's scorching heat, and the north is at its greenest and most beautiful. Campsite prices remain at low-season rates through most of April, only beginning to rise in May. This is also an excellent time for hiking the Rota Vicentina, cycling the Ecovia do Algarve, or exploring the Douro Valley before the summer heat sets in. Water temperatures are still cool for swimming, but the landscape more than compensates.",

        'Summer brings the highest prices, the biggest crowds, and the strictest enforcement of camping laws. The Algarve becomes extremely busy, with campsite prices at their peak and availability often requiring advance booking, especially in August when Portuguese families take their holidays. Inland temperatures can exceed 40\u00b0C in the Alentejo and Douro Valley, making midday outdoor activity uncomfortable. That said, the northern coast and mountain areas offer pleasant summer temperatures and are far less crowded than the south. If you must travel in summer, focus on the Minho, the Douro, and the northern beaches.',

The summer crowds disappear almost overnight in October, but the sea remains warm enough for swimming until mid-November in the Algarve. Campsite prices drop back to low-season rates, the Douro Valley is stunning with autumn colours in the vineyards, and the weather across most of the country is warm, dry, and perfect for outdoor activities. October is also an excellent month for surfing, with consistent Atlantic swells and fewer people in the water.',
